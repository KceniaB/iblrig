# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ develop ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    name: build (${{ matrix.python-version }}, ${{ matrix.os }})
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false  # Whether to stop execution of other instances
