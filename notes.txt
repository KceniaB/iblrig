# testable task notes
# task->sph->paths
# - would like to decide on consistent naming:
#   - no more 'folder' in attribute names
#   - when 'path' is in name, refers to file path, is a path object
#   - when 'dir' is in name, refers to directory, is a path object
#   - when 'file_name' is in name, refers to just the filename, string
# - _BOARD, _PROTOCOL, SUBJECT_NAME, VISUAL_STIMULUS_TYPE, IBLRIG_COMMIT_HASH, IBLRIG_VERSION_TAG seem misplaced

# task->sph->pybpod
# - may want to rename class to pybpod, maybe not
# - PYBPOD_SESSION_PATH could be moved to paths
# - SETTING_PRIORITY can go away

# task->sph->settings
# - NAME(board_name) could be moved and renamed to pybpod

# task->sph->task
# - may want to rename to parameters, otherwise looks ok

# DONE:
# - DATA_FOLDER_LOCAL, DATA_FOLDER_REMOTE and SETTING_PRIORITY removed
# - git wrappers and tag warnings removed
# - yaml files updated and task class renamed
